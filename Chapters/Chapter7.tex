\section{Conclusion}
The proposed approach could successfully detect Keyframe and motion frame from given set frames from Adavus video. Optical flow help in the extraction of the feature.

Histogram of optical flow (HOOF) and histogram binning successfully helps in feature vector extraction. It is used as a final feature vector to train the binary SVM classifier.
Approach $3$ gives the best accuracy among all approaches because we are covering the whole image by block by block. It helps in the preservation of information and optical flow of the image.
